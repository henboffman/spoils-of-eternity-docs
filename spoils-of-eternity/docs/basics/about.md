# About Spoils of Eternity

I'm creating Spoils of Eternity to fill a void in mobile games for a casual action RPG driven by loot. Designed for portrait orientation so that you don't need to get into game mode to play it, and devoid of premium currency. Support and updates will be best effort to keep this free.
