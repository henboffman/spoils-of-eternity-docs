# Item Modifiers

## Logic

Each Item rarity has a maximum number of possible modifiers that can roll upon item generation. Should the same modifier type roll multiple times on a single item, the modifier will appear only once on the item, with the value equal to the sum of the randomized values. 

| Rarity      | Maximum rolled modifiers |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Normal      | 1       |
| Magic   | 2        |
| Rare   | 3        |
| Set   | 4        |
| Epic   | 5        |
| Unique   | 6        |
