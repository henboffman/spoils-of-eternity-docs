# One character class with a skill tree

Since I had already attempted to create multiple character classes, there will be some effort to remove content in the name of progress. 

- [ ] Remove existing classes as selectable option on character create. Only keep the barbarian class

## UI

- [ ] Update horizontal portrait for character creation screen. In fact, probably redo that screen altogether
- [ ] Update vertical portrait for character select screen
- [ ] Update avatar displayed in inventory/equipment screen to something less serious
- [ ] Update the in-game sprite to look something like a barbarian

## Skill Tree

- [ ] Update the background to something less distracting. Maybe use solid color/gradient?
- [ ] Update skill sprites to match new cartoony aesthetic. 
- [ ] Redo the skill popup/dialog, and all associated buttons.
