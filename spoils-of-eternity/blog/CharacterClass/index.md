# One character class with a skill tree

Since I had already attempted to create multiple character classes, there will be some effort to remove content in the name of progress.

- [x] Remove existing classes as selectable option on character create. Only keep the barbarian class

## UI

- [x] Update horizontal portrait for character creation screen. In fact, probably redo that screen altogether
- [x] Update vertical portrait for character select screen
- [x] Update avatar displayed in inventory/equipment screen to something less serious
- [ ] Update the in-game sprite to look something like a barbarian

## Skill Tree

- [x] Update the background to something less distracting. Maybe use solid color/gradient?
- [x] Update skill sprites to match new aesthetic.
- [x] Redo the skill popup/dialog, and all associated buttons.
