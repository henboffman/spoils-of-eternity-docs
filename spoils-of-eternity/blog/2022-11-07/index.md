I started working on creating audio for the game and got sidetracked for a majority of October making an album of music to use as background focus music while programming. Time well spent? Not sure. But I need to pick back up on this, which will be a challenge, because I stopped in the middle of implementing skill functionality, genericizing some functionality and data structure into scriptable objects. Since that will be tough to jump back into, I need to create some low-hanging fruit items to get the momentum going. So, why not a roadmap?

Multi-character functionality isn't top priority for an MVP. Having a single class to get the core gameplay in place seems more achievable. So-
1. One character class with a skill tree
2. Different acts

    a. Different item types/progression
    
    b. Improved odds of unique item drop for some bosses?
      
3. Different mob types in the acts
4. A few different enemy types (melee, ranged, caster, tank) to create some variation. 
5. Refine some of the art to get rid of the super serious aesthetic. The art doesn't match the game, and I think creates inaccurate assumptions that the game simply wont satisfy.
6. Create unique items that are actually unique, and provide somegame-changing functionality beyond just stat modifications
7. Leaderboards, or something that will incentivize playing the game
8. On the subject of playing the game, improve the interactability ofthe core gameplay loop, so that it's more than just a fire-and-forgetidle game.
9. Add audio to the game. And reduce how ridiculous it is with loudsound effects on every hit
10. Maybe some type of cloud-driven auction house? Probably not an MVP item. 
11. Update the way acts and levels are managed. Create themes for the different acts, and update the waypoint screen with some art for each of the different acts.
