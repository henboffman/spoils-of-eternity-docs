It seems that the direction of the game for v1 will be a single set of skills, one character class, and a number of passive skills that can modify how the game is played, which somewhat helps circumvent the need for multiple character classes. But, the skill tree needs to be usable, and not overly complicated, as the goal is primarily accessibility. 

1. Add passive skill tree
2. Capture and track unlocked passives
