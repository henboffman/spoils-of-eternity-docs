# 0.0.93 Update

## Changes

1. Updated health bar position on screen to accommodate joystick position
2. Updated health bar color to slight red to indicate connection to health
3. Updated character selection and creation menu
4. Made reduced the dungeon flow tilemap size from 10x10 to 5x5 to expedite in-level debugging. This will eventually be tied to the game level, with higher levels likely being larger
5. Modified movement controls to remove joystick sprite and instead allow input from any location in center of screen
6. Remaining enemies text now has color gradient applied when value changes
7. Significantly improved performance by modifying logic to monitor units in level.
8. Removed the boss character logic in the `WaveSpawner`. There was something wrong with the animation causing this character to misbehave, and given that unit variants are targeted for the [[1.0 - PLANNED]] update, it just seems easier to remove it altogether for now.
9. Removed old dungeon background backdrop image

## New Features

1. Arrow points towards next target, and turns green and points to waypoint if no remaining targets in level.
2. Arrow scales to indicate distance to next target
3. Added settings menu
4. Added ability to clear local data from device
5. Added effect to level-end waypoint after all enemies are cleared
6. Added text to interface to display distance to target
7. Added destroyable crates to dungeon generation

## Bugfixes

1. Resolved issue where player speed was initializing incorrectly for new characters
